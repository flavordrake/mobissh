# MobiSSH native — release notes

Curated, USER-FACING notes rendered on the install page (native.html). Newest
section first; the generator renders the TOP section's bullets as "What to
verify". Each bullet: ONE short line, what changed — NOT how to test it. Keep
internal/test/CI/refactor work OUT. **Update this every release** (the gate
refuses to ship if the top section's commit is older than the build — see
gen-apk-install-page.sh staleness check).

## Build 2026-06-01e — full theme set + compose auto-focus
- 38 terminal themes (was 2) — assign a different one per session from the session menu.
- A profile's saved theme now applies automatically when you connect it.
- Profile editor: theme is a picker (all themes), not a text field.
- Compose bar grabs focus on open — straight into voice/swipe.

## Build 2026-06-01d — keyboard no longer covers the bottom bar (P0)
- Bottom session bar floats above the soft keyboard instead of being covered by it.
- Compose bar docks to a fixed top/bottom margin — no longer off-screen or hiding the session bar.
- Compose toggle on the session bar (right edge); swipe-type + voice land with correct spaces.
- Per-session font size + theme from the session menu.
- Keybar: one scrollable line, monochrome arrows, ^keys grouped at the end.

## Build 2026-06-01 — reliability sweep (verify on device)
- Profiles screen is now a clean chooser: TAP a saved profile to connect, tap the PENCIL to edit it, "New connection" to add one. The old inline host/port/Connect form is gone.
- Creating or editing a connection: the "Save & connect" / "Save" buttons stay ABOVE the keyboard — fill in a new key-auth host and confirm you can actually reach and tap them.
- Reconnect gives you a LIVE shell every time: connect, drop/disconnect, reconnect — the terminal should accept typing again (no frozen "connected but dead" screen).
- Opening the bottom session menu while typing should NOT drop the keyboard or make the screen jump.
- Long-press on the terminal opens Copy / Select all / Paste.
- Downloading a LARGE file or a PDF over SFTP should arrive intact (not corrupted) — try a multi-megabyte file.
- Re-importing your profiles applies the correct auth mode — a key profile shows as KEY (not password) after import.

## Build 2026-05-31 — earlier UX pass
- Tap-to-connect from a saved profile; pencil opens a full profile editor (title, host, port, user, auth, initial command, theme).
- Bundled JetBrains Mono terminal font; terminal theme cycling.
- Gesture pass: horizontal swipe on the session bar switches sessions.

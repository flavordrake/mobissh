// Ghostty (flterm / libghostty-vt) session terminal view (#684, #582, #686).
//
// The OPT-IN alternate to the xterm.dart `TerminalView` rendered by
// `_SessionTerminalBody` in terminal_screen.dart. Selected via the persisted
// `terminalBackendProvider` (TerminalBackend.ghostty); the xterm path stays the
// default and is untouched.
//
// Why flterm: libghostty-vt gives NATIVE touch long-press select + copy, which
// xterm.dart v4 lacks (no selection-extend API — #582). This widget wires an
// flterm `TerminalController` to the SAME live session I/O the xterm path uses:
//
//   proxy.output (PTY bytes)        -> controller.write(bytes)
//   controller.onOutput (keystrokes)-> proxy.sendInput(bytes)   [gated: connected]
//   controller.onResize (cols,rows) -> proxy.sendResize(cols, rows)
//
// #686 polish (the device-tested v0.1.4 MVP rendered + selected but was rough):
//   1. Per-session FONT + SIZE parity with the xterm path. flterm carries the
//      font on `TerminalTheme` (fontFamily/fontSize/fontWeight), not a separate
//      textStyle — see [buildGhosttyTheme]. The view reads the SAME #679/#640
//      per-session providers the xterm body reads, so two visible sessions can
//      differ and a session defaults to the readable bundled JetBrainsMono face
//      (the prior hardcoded `TerminalTheme.dark()` 'JetBrains Mono' rendered
//      thin/unreadable on device).
//   2. SCROLL-vs-SELECT: a plain vertical drag must SCROLL the scrollback;
//      selection starts on LONG-PRESS. flterm's default `enabledSelections`
//      includes `drag` — see [kGhosttyScrollSettings] for why we drop it.
//   3. SELECTION endpoints / control: best achievable on flterm 0.0.3 — see the
//      "selection control" note below + a Select-All affordance.
//
// #688 fix (SWIPE STILL drag-selected after #686): the root cause was NOT
// `drag`. flterm restricts its pan/drag recognizer to `PointerDeviceKind.mouse`
// and its LONG-PRESS recognizer to `PointerDeviceKind.touch`
// (terminal_raw_gesture_detector.dart). Scroll comes from the inner `Scrollable`
// (terminal_view.dart), NOT flterm's gesture detector. On a finger SWIPE the
// brief start-of-swipe dwell makes flterm's `LongPressGestureRecognizer` win the
// arena; `onLongPressMoveUpdate` -> `_updateDrag` then paints a multi-line
// selection AND auto-scrolls. So `SelectionGesture.longPress` (which #686 KEPT)
// was the culprit, not `drag`. The owner wants swipe = scroll-ONLY; selection =
// DELIBERATE. We default to NO touch drag-select (`longPress` dropped) so a
// swipe only scrolls, and gate long-press-drag selection behind an explicit
// "select mode" toggle — see [kGhosttyScrollSettings] / [kGhosttySelectSettings]
// and `_selectMode`.
//
// #690 fix (SWIPE forwarded to the REMOTE as a mouse-button DRAG): distinct
// from #688's LOCAL selection. When the remote enables mouse mode (DECSET
// 1000/1002/1003/1006, e.g. tmux), flterm's `TerminalGestureDetector` forwards a
// finger swipe to the PTY as a button1 press+motion+release — a DRAG — which tmux
// reads as a mouse SELECTION (its own selection styling appears). flterm 0.0.3
// exposes NO interception hook analogous to xterm's `Terminal.mouseHandler` (the
// #617 fix): the report path is fully internal to its gesture detector,
// `TerminalGestureSettings` explicitly CANNOT disable mouse tracking, and the
// only built-in bypass (virtual Shift) leaks into key/scroll encoding and clears
// on the next keystroke. So we intercept ONE layer up — see
// [_PointerGestureRouter] / [ghosttySwipeShouldScrollLocally]. The wheel
// reports flterm emits for an actual scroll ARE correct (libghostty's own SGR
// wheel encoding, not xterm-4.0.0's buggy 68/69 — so no #617-style fix is needed
// for the wheel path here).
//
// #692 (DROP the #688 mode toggle — the GESTURE decides): the explicit select-
// mode toggle is gone. The pointer-absorbing overlay is now a gesture ROUTER:
//   - a finger SWIPE (movement first) -> scroll (the #690 path, unchanged);
//   - a deliberate LONG-PRESS (held stationary ~500ms) then drag -> SELECTION.
// We drive the selection OURSELVES rather than letting flterm forward it: flterm
// 0.0.3 does NOT export its pixel->cell mapping (`CellMetrics.cellAt`) or its
// internal mouse encoder, and libghostty's `MouseEncoder` is native FFI (not
// headless-testable) and not re-exported by flterm. So on a long-press-drag we
// synthesise SGR-1006 mouse reports — button1 press at the long-pressed cell,
// motion as the finger drags (deduped per cell), release on lift — and send them
// to the remote via `proxy.sendInput`. tmux then runs its OWN precise, native
// selection. The overlay is opaque while mouse tracking is on (so flterm never
// sees the raw touch), so the only mouse reports the remote gets are the ones WE
// emit: a swipe scrolls and reports nothing; a long-press-drag selects.
//
// Cell mapping is viewport-relative (1-based col;row), which is exactly what tmux
// mouse mode expects — and the overlay is active ONLY under mouse tracking, where
// flterm pins the viewport to the bottom (no scrollback offset to compensate). We
// derive the cell size from the overlay's laid-out size / the live (cols, rows)
// captured from `controller.onResize`.
//
// SMART-SELECT (future, do NOT build here): a future button could select a word/
// path/URL UNIT at the tap — the PWA's `src/modules/selection.ts _selectableUnitAt`
// is the spec. The seam is [GhosttySelectionDriver] + [ghosttyCellForPosition]:
// resolve a unit's start/end cell, then drive press(start) -> motion(end) ->
// release to make tmux select that span. Not implemented in #692.
//
// flterm re-exports libghostty's `Key` input enum, which collides with
// Flutter's widget `Key`. We only use Flutter's, so hide flterm's.
